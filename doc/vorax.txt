WHAT IS VORAX                                                   *vorax-whatis*

VoraX is a minimalist Oracle IDE based on the well known Vim editor. The main
reasons which motivate us to develop this plugin are:

	- the power of Vim editor. When applied to Oracle development or 
	  database administration it brings a lot of efficiency and fun.

	- the need for a cross platform tool. Vim editor is available on many
	  platforms which means you're free to use whatever OS you like.

	- availability as a console IDE. Having a shiny IDE on a slow SSH
	  connection doesn't sound so good, does it? A DBA will be pleased 
	  running VoraX in a console because, usually, is so used running OS 
	  commands, scripts etc. and, of course, the terminal is his/her best 
	  friend. With VoraX in place you don't need to leave your beloved 
	  console anymore.

	- having an IDE with a very small footprint. VoraX is nothing but a 
	  collection of VimL and Ruby scripts provided as a Vim plugin. We 
	  hope VoraX will consume as less resources as possible.

	- the dream of an improved SqlPLUS environment. I know a lot of guys
	  (including me) who intensively use SqlPLUS, even for complex tasks. 
	  On the other hand its limitations are quite annoying: we want good 
	  code completion, pretty print output and so on. We cannot get rid of 
	  SqlPLUS because we still think it is a great tool but we can make it 
	  better. This is another goal of VoraX.

VoraX stands for Vim ORAcle eXtension. It acts like a wrapper on the SqlPLUS
environment. Every call to the database is made through SqlPLUS but in a
hidden way so that the user is not aware of that. This approach has pros and
cons. From one hand it inherits all those nice SqlPLUS features like explain
plans, column computations and so on, but on the other hand it has to deal
with all the limitations of the SqlPLUS (formatting output, syntax highlight
etc.) To fill this gap is the whole idea of VoraX.

FEATURES                                                      *vorax-features*

VoraX comes with the following features:

	- Advanced code completion for database object names, columns, aliases
	  and procedure/function parameters;

	- A database objects browser. You may browse tables, views, packages
	  and so on. The options available for every type of object may be
	  extended through custom plugins;

	- Connection profiles. VoraX allows to store various connection
	  strings, including the corresponding passwords. All these passwords
	  are protected using a master password.
	
	- An output window where the results of running various statements are
	  displayed. Within this window logging may be started in order to
	  save everything is written there into a file on disk for future
	  inspection.
	
	- Support for editing and compiling PL/SQL modules like packages,
	  types, procedure and functions.

	- Convenient key mappings for: describe object under cursor, execute
	  current statement etc. 
	
	- Pretty print output. You may switch to a vertical columns output or
	  to a compressed format. In a compressed output all columns width are
	  resized according to the length of the contained data.
