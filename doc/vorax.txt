VoraX is a minimalist Oracle IDE based on the well known Vim editor. The main
reasons which motivate us to develop this plugin are:

	- the power of Vim editor. When applied to Oracle development or 
	  for database administration it brings a lot of efficiency and fun.

	- the need for a cross platform tool. Vim editor is available on many
	  platforms which means you're free to use whatever OS you like.

	- availability as a console IDE. Having a shiny IDE on a slow SSH
	  connection doesn't sound so good, does it? A DBA will be pleased 
	  running VoraX in a console because, usually, is so used running OS 
	  commands, scripts etc. and, of course, the terminal is his/her best 
	  friend. With VoraX in place you don't need to leave your beloved 
	  console anymore.

	- having an IDE with a very small footprint. VoraX is nothing but a 
	  collection of VimL and Ruby scripts provided as a Vim plugin. We 
	  hope VoraX will consume as less resources as possible.

	- the dream of an improved SqlPLUS environment. I know a lot of guys
	  (including me) who intensivelly use SqlPLUS, even for complex tasks. 
	  On the other hand its limitations are quite annoying: we want good 
	  code completion, pretty print output and so on. We cannot get rid of 
	  SqlPLUS because we still think it is a great tool but we can make it 
	  better. This is another goal of VoraX.
